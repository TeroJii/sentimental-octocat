# Introduction

Here I will add some brief notes about analyzing data in text format. The following two books helped me out tremendously [@Silge2017; @Hvitfeldt2022].

## Some basic concepts related to handling text

+ String: a data type consisting of a sequence of characters

+ Token: a meaningful unit of text such as a word, sentence, lines of text, paragraphs etc.

+ [Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus): In linguistics, a corpus (plural corpora) or text corpus is a language resource consisting of a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed). In NLP context, corpus usually stores the text along with metadata.

+ Document-term matrix: a matrix where each row presents one document (such as a book or article), each column represents one term, and each value states the number of appearances in of that term in the document [@Silge2017]
