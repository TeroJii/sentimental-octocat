In NLP context, corpus usually stores the text along with metadata.\nDocument-term matrix: a matrix where each row presents one document (such as a book or article), each column represents one term, and each value states the number of appearances in of that term in the document (Silge and Robinson 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\nHvitfeldt, E., and J.
