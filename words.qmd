# Extracting and Analyzing Words

## Words as Tokens

In order to analyze natural language, the raw text needs to be somehow transformed into a numeric format. 


## TF-IDF

Term frequency (TF), inverse document frequency (IDF), and their product (TF-IDF) which describes the frequency of the term adjusted for how rarely it is used [@Silge2017], are all quantities which can be used for assessing the importance of a word in a passage of text.

> The statistic tf-idf is intended to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection (or corpus) of documents, for example, to one novel in a collection of novels or to one website in a collection of websites.
